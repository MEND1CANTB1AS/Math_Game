# The Floor is Lava: Math Edition

# Overview

We have created an elementary level math game intended to help children to review and memorize basic math problems. An unanswered math equation that uses one of the four basic operators (+, -, x, รท) appears in the middle of the screen and six possible numbers appear around the screen, only one is correct. The player has 30 seconds to determine the correct answer and move to that number before they lose a life! Each time the player gets the answer right, they earn 5 points. If they get the answer wrong, they lose 1 point. The player has three lives to get as many answers right and earn as many points as they can. The player must be careful not to fall of the edge and to avoid the lava at the bottom of screen. The high scores will be recorded in *The Floor is Lava Hall of Fame.* The user moves the player by useing the arrow keys or A, S, D, W keys. Once an the answer number is collected or the 60 second timer runs out then the problem equation, timer, and most of the numbers on the screen are reset for a new round so that the player can earn more points. The game will end once the player runs out of lives or earns 50 or more points.
